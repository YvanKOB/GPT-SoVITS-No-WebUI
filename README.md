Welcome to the **GPT-SoVITS-No-WebUI-Colab** repository! This project provides a Colab notebook for generating text-to-speech (TTS) using the GPT-SoVITS model without a web user interface.

## Overview

This repository aims to simplify the process of generating speech from text using the GPT-SoVITS model in Google Colab. With this setup, you can generate high-quality voice outputs by specifying text inputs and optionally providing reference audio.

## Features

- Easy setup and usage with Google Colab
- Support for multiple languages, including English, Chinese, and Japanese
- Optional reference audio for enhancing the quality of generated speech
- Adjustable parameters for customizing the TTS output

## Usage

1. Open the Colab notebook.
2. Follow the instructions to set up the environment and dependencies.
3. Specify your model name, GPT and SoVITS epochs, text input, language, and other settings.
4. Run the notebook to generate speech from your specified text.
